# YAJER README

The README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running. This one also does so. Well, kind of.

## What is this all about?

This is Yet Another Jest Runner. It will scan the currently open document for tests adn will provide an option to run each and every one of them

> Tip: You can pick up the necessary jest configuration at runtime per file

## Right, but how to use it?

Just hover the small run icon at the end of you test statement line and choose a command from the tooltip provided.

## Who do I talk to?

- For bugs / improvements / suggestions contact the repo owner
- For beer do the same
